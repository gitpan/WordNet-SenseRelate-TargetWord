=item disamb.pl

Performs Word Sense Disambiguation on Senseval-2 lexical sample data. It
uses the WordNet::SenseRelate::Reader::Senseval2 module to read a Senseval2
lexical sample file, and then disambiguates each of the instances using the
WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord module.

Usage: disamb.pl [ [--config FILE] [--wnpath WNPATH] [--trace] XMLFILE | --help | --version]

B<--config>=I<FILENAME>         
    Specifies a configuration file (FILENAME) to set up the various
    configuration options.

B<--wnpath>=I<WNPATH>         
    WNPATH specifies the path of the WordNet data files. Ordinarily, this
    path is determined from the $WNHOME environment variable. But this
    option overides this behavior.

B<--trace>
    Indicates that trace information be printed.

B<--help>
    Displays this help screen.

B<--version>
    Displays version information.


Example:

To disambiguate an English lexical sample file using the default options

  disamb.pl eng-lex-samp.xml

To dismabiguate an English lexical sample file, specifying configuration
options and trace output

  disamb.pl --config config.txt --trace eng-lex-sample.xml

=item wps2sk.pl

Creates a word#pos#sense to sensekey mapping of a Senseval-2 answer file
(output by disamb.pl). In order to be able to evaluate the output of
disamb.pl using software provided by the Senseval organizers, we need to
covert the output of disamb.pl to the "SenseKey" format.

Usage: wps2sk.pl [ [ --wnpath WNPATH] [FILE...] | --help | --version ]

B<--wnpath>=I<WNPATH>
    WNPATH specifies the path of the WordNet data files. Ordinarily, this
    path is determined from the $WNHOME environment variable. But this
    option overides this behavior.

B<--quiet>
    Run in quiet mode -- does not print informational messages. But it does
    print warning or error messages if any.

B<--help>
    Displays this help screen.

B<--version>
    Displays version information.

Example:

To convert a captured output from disamb.pl

  wps2sk.pl output.txt

Typically used in a pipe with disamb.pl

  disamb.pl xmlfile.xml | wps2sk.pl --quiet

=item disamb-gui.pl

Performs Word Sense Disambiguation on Senseval-2 lexical sample data
(graphical interface to WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord). It uses the
WordNet::SenseRelate::Reader::Senseval2 module to read a Senseval2 lexical
sample file, and then allows the user to pick the instances that she wishes
to disambiguate.

Usage: disamb-gui.pl [ [--config FILE] [--wnpath WNPATH] [XMLFILE] | --help | --version]

B<--config>=I<FILENAME>
    Specifies a configuration file (FILENAME) to set up the various
    configuration options.

B<--wnpath>=I<WNPATH>
    WNPATH specifies the path of the WordNet data files. Ordinarily, this
    path is determined from the $WNHOME environment variable. But this
    option overides this behavior.

B<--help>
    Displays this help screen.

B<--version>
    Displays version information.
